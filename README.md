#Guessing Game

This is a guessing game.
The computer will pick a number between 1 and 100.
Your task is to try and guess what that number is, in as little guesses as possible.
The rules are simple: 1. You have an unlimited number of guesses. 2. Any guesses below 1 and greater than 100 are considered out of bounds.

Hope You enjoy
